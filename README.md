This R code is a take-home assignment that conducts an a-priori power analysis on a dataset. The code uses the Quarto publishing system to create a reproducible report that presents the results of the power analysis in a clear and consistent manner. By using Quarto, the report can be easily shared and reproduced, ensuring the reproducibility and transparency of the research results. 

The file `analysis.qmd` contains all the code to run the analysis and create the figures. Running `quarto render analysis.qmd --to pdf` then produces `analysis.pdf`.
